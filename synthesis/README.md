Synthesis tools
===============

The source code for the synthesis tools and experiments is divided
in different subdirectories as follows:

  - `direct`: scripts for generating direct SAT encoding
  - `symsync`: source code for the symsync solver
  - `experiments`: scripts for running the experiments
  - `tools`: auxilary tools 

Each subdirectory contains its own README files for further instructions.

Requirements:

  - Python 2.6 
  - MiniSAT 2.2.0 sources (to compile symsync)
  - lingeling and MiniSAT solvers

Lingeling and MiniSAT executables should available in the PATH.
